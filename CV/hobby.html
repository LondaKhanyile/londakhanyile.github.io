  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

  <h3>Playing Soccer</h3>
  <p>I started playing soccer in primary school and I fell in love ever since. <br>
  I still hope to get a chance to play it once again, maybe for a small club or even an indoor team.

  <h3>Watching Formula 1</h3>
  <p>I was introduced to Formula 1 last year through the popular Netflix Series, Drive To Survive. <br>
  My favourite driver is <em>Carlos Sainz Jr.</em> of <em>Scuderia Ferrari.</em> He works hard and is very passionate about driving.

  <h3>Coding</h3>
  <p>I love coding because it allows you to create whatever you can think of. <br>
  I want to practice this skill until I master coding paradigms.
